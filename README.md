# Team Profile Generator
# Description
This project is made using Node Js and Npm packages such as inquirer and jest. In this project, the user/manager will use a command-line app where he/she can input his/her info and his team's basic info. After he/she finish inputing everyone's info it will  generate a webpage which displays the team's basic info. This way the manager will have access on everyone's github and emails.

The photos below shows the command-line and the generated html.
